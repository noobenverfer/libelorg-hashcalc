# libelorg-hashcalc
A test library, for test purposes; there is not much to see here. This library is a simple calculator that estimates the earnings of a cryptocurrency within a given time period. 

This library was created as a test of compatibility of w64devkit/GCC/make/SciTE with designing and building C++ programs under Windows 2000. However, I have plans to perhaps repurpose this library in the future to connect to the Internet to retrieve that values that it uses to make the calculations which would give it perhaps a bit of use in some future application.

That's all, folks.
